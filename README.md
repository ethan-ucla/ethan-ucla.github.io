I’m Ethan.

If we look at life from first principles, the modern human experience is defined by rigid angles, digital noise, and unnecessary complexity. My solution to this entropy is simple: I optimize for softness and silence.

That is why I own the Bear.

The Skog Doctrine
Most people see a Djungelskog and see a stuffed animal. I see the apex of comfort engineering.

Form: He is the perfect sphere of lethargy.

Function: He provides a tangible counterweight to the crushing weight of existential dread.

Vibe: He does not judge; he merely observes with a heavy, brown, polyester gaze.

I am interested in things that are tangible and authentic. I like heavy books, analog audio, and oversized Swedish textiles. I dislike small talk and uncomfortable chairs.

Current Status
Currently curating a life that allows for maximum downtime. If you need me, I am likely drinking black coffee and explaining the socioeconomic implications of fast furniture to a bear who cannot hear me.

Don’t ask me to go hiking. The Skog is indoor-only, and therefore, so am I.
